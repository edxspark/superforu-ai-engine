## Why use SuperforuAIEngine?
***
Langchain/LlamaIndex provide easy to use abstractions that can be used for quick experimentation and prototyping. 
But, when things move to production, there are constraints like the External knowledge base integration, 
complex text parsing, precise knowledge extraction, tool custom routing encapsulation, response custom encapsulation etc. 

## Introduction
SuperforuAIEngine is an open-source data engine to organize your RAG codebase along with a frontend to play around with different RAG customizations. 
It provides a simple way to organize your codebase so that it becomes easy to test it locally while also being able to deploy it in a production ready environment.
